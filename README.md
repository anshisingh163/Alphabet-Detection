    download a zip file

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd alphabet-detection


3. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Download and install the necessary models. Refer to the Models section for more information.

Usage
Ensure that the required dependencies are installed (see Installation).

Run the alphabet detection script:
    python detect_alphabet.py path/to/your/image.jpg

Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to process.

View the results. The script will output the detected alphabet and display the annotated image.
